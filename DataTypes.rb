#Reminder: never use quotation marks (‘ or “) with booleans, or Ruby will think you’re talking about a string (a word or phrase) instead of a value that can be true or false. It’s also important to remember that Ruby is case-sensitive (it cares about capitalization).

my_num = 1
myName = "Umut"
my_boolean = true

puts(my_num,my_boolean,myName)
